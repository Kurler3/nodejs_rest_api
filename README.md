## Data

Had to ask ChatGPT to generate data for me (with the same structure you were asking for in the pdf file), because the URL you specific wasn't working.

## Running the server

First of all, make sure to run "npm i" to install the dependencies I'm using (if the node_modules folder is not present).
Then, run "npm run start". This will trigger a script I have inside package.json, that uses nodemon to run the server and listen to changes, meaning it will restart the server for you whenever you same any file.

The server will then be running at: localhost:4000, or 127.0.0.1:4000
